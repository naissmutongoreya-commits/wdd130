        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="naison mutongoreya">
        <p>My name is Naison Mutongoreya, and I am a motivated and goal-oriented individual with a passion for
            business,
            leadership, and continuous learning. I recently completed my studies in Business Administration and
            Management at
            Brigham Young University Idaho and am currently pursuing a diploma in Mining Engineering, as well as a
            degree in
            Software Development. I have experience working as a Data Specialist and Executive Secretary, where I
            developed strong
            organizational, communication, and problem-solving skills. I love learning new things, working with
            people, and
            exploring creative ideas. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, exploring new places, and
            spending time with
            family. My long-term goal is to become a manager and contribute positively to the success of any
            organization I work
            with.</p>
